Python does not strictly use "pass by value" or "pass by reference" in the same way as languages like C++ or Java. 
Instead, Python employs a mechanism known as pass by object reference (or pass by assignment). 
This means that when you pass an object to a function, you're passing a reference to that object, but the reference itself is passed by value.

Summary
1)Pass by Object Reference: Python passes a reference to the object, but whether that object can be modified depends on its mutability.
2)Immutability: If you try to change an immutable object, you create a new object instead of modifying the original.
3)Mutability: If you change a mutable object, the changes affect the original object.
Thus, while Python does not have traditional "pass by value" or "pass by reference," it effectively combines elements of both depending on the type of object being passed.
